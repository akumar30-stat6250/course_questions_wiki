**Chapter1**

1.  \[Chapter 1, Problem 3\] Can a variable's type be both character and
    numeric?

    Answer: No, a variable can be numeric or character. Numeric values
    represent numbers, can be read in a variety of ways, and are stored
    in floating-point format. Character values can contain letters,
    numbers, and special characters and can be from 1 to 32,767
    characters long.

2.  \[Chapter 1, Problem 1\] Does SAS make the distinction between a
    variable and an array?

    Answer: array is a set of variables grouped together for the
    duration of a data step by being given a name in an ARRAY statement.

3.  \[Chapter 1, Problem 3\] Are there traditional variables found in
    SAS, variables without attributes?

    Answer: all variables have its own attributes.

4.  \[Chapter 1, Problem 5\] Is there a maximum length for variables?

    Answer: default is 8 bytes for numeric and character.

5.  \[Ch. 1, Q1\] Is it possible to have a completely empty observation?
    Would there be any reason to allow this?

    Answer: It’s possible to create an empty dataset by stopping process
    before output.

6.  \[Ch. 1, Q3\] In this problem, AcctNum appears like it should be set
    to a numeric type. What must be done to update it's type and correct
    the values? The first two need their underscores removed. 'Romano'
    and 'Choi' are names, not account numbers.

    Answer: Once a variable is defined numeric or character, you cannot
    change it's data type, you must create a new variable.

7.  \[Ch. 1, Q8\] Why was 8 bytes chosen? Is it efficient to store all
    variables with such a large precision?

    Answer: 8 bytes is 64bits, which most CPUs today are
    64-bit architecture.

**Chapter2**

1.  \[Chapter 2, Problem 3\] Is a file format engine a type of dataset?

    Answer: A library engine is an engine that accesses groups of files
    and puts them into a logical form for processing by SAS. It’s a set
    of code and instruction.

2.  \[Chapter 2, Problem 8\] How are namespace conflict issues resolved
    when two libraries are needed which have the same naming naming
    conventions and same names?

    Answer: SAS won’t allow to create or move a library at a location
    that has an existing library with the same name.

3.  \[Chapter 2, Problem 3\] With 4 digit year values in data lines to
    be read correctly, does it mean that the YEARCUTOFF=option can be
    eliminated in the program data lines?

    Answer: yes.

4.  \[Chapter 2, Problem 7\] What is a libref? Can a libref be within a
    DATA, SET, or PROC statement?

    Answer: To create a new SAS library with SAS code, you use the
    LIBNAME statement. The LIBNAME statement associates the name of the
    library, or libref, with the physical location of the library.
    LIBNAME statement can be executed in bot DATA or PROC step.

5.  \[Chapter 2, Problem 7\] Can I name a library with some key words
    like SPSS? 

    Answer: SAS reserves a few names for automatic variables and
    variable lists, SAS data sets, and librefs, such as WORK, SASHELPER,
    SASUSER…

6.  \[Chapter 2, Problem 8\] If a data set with two-digit year values
    has the range of the year more than 100, how to set YEARCUTOFF=
    value? how to process the year correctly?

    Answer: The YEARCUTOFF= option cannot reliably assign centuries
    to two-digit years if the range of dates for a variable is greater
    than 100 years. If the date ranges for a variable span more than 100
    years, you must either specify the dates with 4-digit years, or use
    DATA step logic to assign a century to each year (perhaps based on
    the value of another variable). 

7.  \[Chapter 2, Problem 9\]  How to reference a library which is also a
    data file ? for example, libname rptdata spss 'g:\\myspss.spss';

    Answer: libname xdb excel "c:\\mymachine\\pcfdata\\demo.xlsx";
